# Java ATM Simulator

Welcome to the Java ATM Simulator project! This repository is dedicated to building a realistic ATM simulation in Java. Whether you're a Java enthusiast or interested in understanding banking systems, this project offers an interactive way to explore the functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM).

## Description
The Java ATM Simulator project aims to create a user-friendly and feature-rich simulation of an ATM. As a virtual ATM, users will be able to perform typical banking operations, such as withdrawing cash, checking account balances, transferring funds, and managing their accounts. This project will provide a safe and educational environment for users to familiarize themselves with ATM operations.

## Key Features
User Authentication: Implement a secure login system where users can input their account credentials and PIN to access their accounts.

Account Management: Allow users to view their account balances, transaction history, and update their account information.

Cash Withdrawal: Enable users to withdraw cash from their accounts, considering available balance and denominations.

Fund Transfers: Implement a fund transfer feature, allowing users to transfer money between their own accounts or to other beneficiaries.

Receipt Generation: Provide users with transaction receipts for successful operations.

Error Handling: Create robust error handling mechanisms to address invalid inputs and ensure the smooth functioning of the ATM.

## How to Get Started
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/dawidolko/Programming-Java/Projects/Baza.git
```
Study the existing codebase to understand the structure of the ATM simulator and the implemented functionalities.

Begin by building the user authentication system, followed by account management and cash withdrawal functionalities.

Test the simulation thoroughly, and make improvements as needed to enhance user experience and security.

## System Requirements
JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your machine.

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ, or NetBeans for a seamless coding experience.

## Contributions and Support
Contributions to the Java ATM Simulator project are highly encouraged. If you have ideas for adding new features or optimizing existing code, feel free to open a pull request.

If you encounter any issues or have questions, please don't hesitate to reach out via email or GitHub.

Get ready to experience the convenience and functionalities of an ATM right from your computer through this Java ATM Simulator! Happy coding and happy banking!
